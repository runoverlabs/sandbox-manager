# Working inside a microsandbox

This file is **managed centrally**. The host builds it from msb-manager's shipped
text plus the operator's own additions, and copies it to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` on
every sandbox start. Editing it inside the sandbox achieves nothing — the copy is
overwritten on the next start, and the source is on a read-only mount. Changes
belong on the host.

A project's own `CLAUDE.md` is separate, lives in the repo, and wins where the
two disagree.

## Where you are

A microVM, not a container. The project is mounted read-write at `/work` (or,
if this sandbox was set up that way, at the same path as on the host; a new
shell starts there) and presented as the host user, so files you create are owned by them and they can
delete them without `sudo`. You run as root inside the guest; that is a
property of the VM and not a privilege over the host.

Installed packages persist across stop/start but **not across a rebuild**. If
something is worth having every time, say so — it belongs in the manager's
`bootstrap.sh` (on the host, outside your reach) or the project's
`.msb/sandbox.toml`. That file is read by msbctl on the host, and it is
read-only in here: its egress rules, secret bindings and resources are only
applied once the operator approves them on the host, so editing it from inside
the sandbox achieves nothing. Say what should change instead.

## The network will refuse things, and that is the design

Egress is deny-by-default and plain HTTP is denied outright. Only an explicit
allowlist of hosts is reachable, on explicit ports.

**So treat a connection failure as policy before you treat it as an outage.**
Do not retry it, do not look for a proxy, and do not reach for an alternative
mirror — report the exact host and port that was refused. Adding it is one line
in the project's `.msb/sandbox.toml`, made and approved by the operator on the
host, and the whole allowlist is deliberately built from denials that actually
happened rather than from guesses.

If a fetch over `http://` fails, the fix is its `https://` URL. A hostname rule
on a plaintext port is enforced as a set of IP addresses and breaks against
address pools, which is why plaintext is simply off.

## Credentials: you are holding placeholders, not secrets

Three things are wired in, and none of them puts a usable secret inside this VM.

**SSH** goes through an agent forwarded from the host. The agent protocol
crosses; the private key never does.
`~/.ssh/known_hosts` is mounted read-only — you can verify hosts the operator
already trusts and cannot silently add a new one.

**`git push`** to GitHub is already set up, one of two ways, and the section
"This sandbox" at the end says which: over https with `GH_TOKEN` through gh's
credential helper, or over SSH through the agent with one chosen key. Either
way git rewrites the remote's URL itself (`insteadOf` in `/etc/gitconfig`), so
never change a remote's URL or add a credential helper to make a push work.

**`GH_TOKEN`** is an opaque placeholder. The real token is substituted on the
host, into request **headers only**, on the way out to `github.com` and
`api.github.com`. So this works:

```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GH_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
gh api user
```

`https://x:$GH_TOKEN@api.github.com/…` works as well — curl turns userinfo into
an `Authorization: Basic` header before sending, so that is a header too.

What does **not** work is a placeholder in a query string or a request body.
Those are outside the headers, so the real value is never substituted there and
the request either fails or carries meaningless literal text. That is the
design, not a bug. Never try to work around it by moving a credential into a
URL — report what refused you instead.

Never run `gh auth login`. It would try to store a credential that is not real.

**Claude's own credential** is bound the same way and is not readable here.

Do not print, log, echo or copy any of these values anywhere. They are
placeholders, so leaking one costs nothing — but the habit is the point, and a
real token reaching a transcript is the failure this whole arrangement exists
to prevent.

## Committing

Identity resolves from the repo's own `.git/config` first. If the repo sets
none, the manager has already applied one at the `--system` level so that
committing works at all. Either way it is the operator's choice — do not set or
change a git identity yourself, and do not pass `--author`.

## Memory

The VM's memory figure is a ceiling, not a reservation. Anonymous memory is
returned to the host automatically, but **guest page cache is never returned on
its own** — so a sandbox that builds a lot drifts up to its ceiling and stays
there. That is expected and harmless; the operator reclaims it from the host
with `msbctl reclaim`. Nothing you can do from in here fixes it, so do not try.
