## Observe mode: building an allowlist

msb doesn't record what it *denies*, only what it *allows*. So the way to learn
what a sandbox actually needs is a round trip:

```console
$ msbctl observe . on --rebuild       # stop blocking, start recording
$ #  … use the sandbox normally for a while …
$ msbctl observe .                    # every host it reached, and which no rule covers
$ msbctl allow . <the ones that belong>
$ msbctl observe . off --rebuild      # back to deny-by-default
```

While observe mode is on, the sandbox is created with egress allowed by
default, **no** `--net-rule` at all, debug logging and DNS rebind protection
off: nothing is blocked and every host is written to the sandbox's runtime
log. Your rules stay in the config and keep being curated; they're just not
emitted. The report prints a ready-made `msbctl allow` line for whatever no
rule covers.

The mode lives in the **registry entry only**, never in `.msb/sandbox.toml`.
That file is committed, and an unfiltered sandbox must never ship to everyone
who clones the project. An `egress_mode` written there is ignored, with a
warning: the file is writable from inside the sandbox, which must not be able
to switch its own filtering off.

The report also shows **secret-policy blocks**: requests msb killed because
they carried a placeholder somewhere substitution isn't allowed. Those are
logged even in normal (enforce) mode.

## Package caches

Each package manager can get its own disk for its download cache: `npm`,
`bun`, `python` (pip), `rust` (cargo registry) and `go` (module cache).

```toml title=".msb/sandbox.toml"
[caches]
npm = "5G"
```

Each is a named disk volume, `<sandbox>-cache-<key>`. It's as fast as the root
disk, capped at its size, **kept** across rebuilds and deleted by `purge`.

```console
$ msbctl cache .                # usage per cache
$ msbctl cache . clear npm      # empty one (all of them without a key)
```

A volume's size is fixed when it's first created. Change it in the config later
and msbctl keeps the existing size and warns you; `msbctl cache . clear` then
recreates it at the new size.

> **Note:** The caches mount at `/mnt/cache/<key>`, and the bootstrap symlinks
> the tool's usual directory (such as `/root/.npm`) to it. That detour is
> deliberate: msb refuses a named-volume mount whose guest path contains a dot.

## Containers inside a sandbox (podman)

The `podman` feature installs podman and opens the `containers` egress group.
podman then needs somewhere to keep images. The root filesystem is an overlay
that podman's overlay driver can't sit on, so pick one of:

- **a container disk** (`containers_disk = "20G"`): a named volume at
  `/var/lib/containers`. Fast, and pulled images survive rebuilds. This is the
  recommended option.
- **fuse-overlayfs** (`containers_storage = "fuse-overlayfs"` under
  `[bootstrap]`, plus the package): no extra disk, slower.

With neither, podman falls back to `vfs`: slow, and about three times the disk.
The wizard asks.

## Resizing without a rebuild

```console
$ msbctl resize . --cpus 8 --memory 16G     # needs a restart; asks first
$ msbctl resize . --root-disk 32G           # grows live; shrinking is refused
```

`resize` uses `msb modify`, so the sandbox keeps its state. The new values are
written to the registry entry, so a later rebuild reproduces them.

## Versions and updates

Component versions are pinned in `defaults.toml` under `[versions]` (node's
major, `gh`, `gitleaks`, `bun`), and the image is pinned by digest.

```console
$ msbctl ls --refresh                  # check upstream (cached for 6 hours)
$ msbctl update . -c claude gh apt     # in place
```

`update` records what it installed in the registry entry's `[versions]` table,
so the next rebuild reproduces it rather than silently going back. Delete an
entry there to return to the default. The **image** can't be updated in place:
change its digest in `.msb/dev.yaml`, then rebuild.

The upstream checks use the anonymous GitHub API (60 requests an hour). A
`GH_TOKEN` in `secrets/global.env` is used for them if present.

## Renaming a sandbox, or moving its project

```console
$ msbctl rename old-name new-name
$ msbctl move . ~/src/the-new-place
```

msb can rename neither a sandbox nor a volume, so a **rename** removes the VM
and creates it again under the new name, at the cost of a rebuild.
Everything msbctl keeps under the name moves with it: the registry entry, its
secrets, the Claude state and the version cache. Package caches and container
images are kept too: the entry's `volumes` key keeps pointing at the existing
disks, and that old name stays reserved until you rename back.

A **move** points the sandbox at a different folder, for example after you
moved the checkout on disk. The old folder may already be gone. If the new
folder has no `.msb/`, msbctl offers to copy it over, re-detects the GitHub
repo, and offers the rebuild the new mount needs.

Both are also in `msbctl edit` → "Name & folder".

## Sandboxes without a folder

`msbctl add --repo owner/name` registers a sandbox that has no folder on this
machine. Its first start clones the repo into a disk volume
(`<name>-workspace`, at `/work`), with the sandbox's own GitHub token as a
placeholder, the same way every other token works. A rebuild finds the clone
there and leaves it alone, unpushed work included; `msbctl purge` deletes it.
Work leaves the sandbox with `git push` from inside it.

```console
$ msbctl add --repo acme/webshop --ref main -y
$ msbctl secret set webshop GH_TOKEN      # a private repo needs it to clone
$ msbctl start webshop
```

**Which `.msb/` governs** is the copy msbctl fetched from GitHub at the pinned
commit, never the checkout inside the sandbox: editing `.msb/sandbox.toml` in
the guest changes nothing until it's pushed and `msbctl policy webshop update`
is run on the host. A rebuild stays on the pinned commit and fetches nothing,
so it can run unattended. A repo with no `.msb/` gets your defaults. A repo
can't set `conf`, and its `dev.yaml` follows the [same rules](configuration.md#msbdevyaml)
as a folder's.

`msbctl allow`, `secret add` and `edit` write to the registry entry, since
there's no checkout to edit, and what they add sits on top of the repo's rules
and bindings rather than replacing them. A change meant to last belongs in the
repo. `move` refuses: there is no folder. No ssh-agent is forwarded,
so `ssh_keys = []`, and git uses HTTPS with the token.

`guest_path` can't be `"host"` (there's no host path) and can't contain a dot
(a disk volume can't be mounted there). The volume's size is `workspace_disk`
(`--workspace-disk`, default 20G), fixed when it's created.

## Where the project appears in the sandbox

By default the project is mounted at `/work`. `msbctl add` asks where it
should appear, and `msbctl edit` → "Name & folder" changes it:

- **the same path as on the host.** Absolute paths in compiler errors, stack
  traces and an agent's output are then valid on both sides, so your editor (or
  an ACP client) can open them as they are. A `msbctl move` takes the mount
  along with it.
- **`/work`.** This keeps your folder layout and username out of the guest.
- **any other absolute path.** Not inside a system folder (`/usr`, `/etc`, …)
  and not over a whole one like `/home` or `/tmp`.

It's stored as `guest_path` in the registry entry (`"host"`, `"/work"` or the
path), never in `.msb/sandbox.toml`, because a host path is one person's
machine. Set the default for new sandboxes in `msbctl setup` → "Defaults for
new sandboxes". A change needs a rebuild, and Claude Code keeps its sessions
and memory per path, so the ones from the old path stay behind.

## Extra folders

```console
$ msbctl mount . ~/reference                      # read-only at /mnt/reference
$ msbctl mount . ~/datasets:/data --rw --rebuild  # read-write, at /data, now
```

Extra host folders are read-only unless you ask, and read-write ones show your
own ownership, like `/work`. Host paths are machine-local, so they're stored in
the registry entry, never in the project. Like every mount, they're fixed at
create time.

## Reaching a server in the sandbox

```console
$ msbctl port . 8080 --rebuild        # http://localhost:8080 reaches :8080 inside
$ msbctl port . 3000:5173             # host 3000 to a dev server on 5173
$ msbctl port .                       # list them; --rm 8080 removes one
```

Inside, the server has to listen on `0.0.0.0` — `python3 -m http.server 8080
--bind 0.0.0.0`, `vite --host 0.0.0.0` — because msb connects to the guest's
own address and a server bound to `localhost` is never reached. On the host the
port binds to `127.0.0.1` only; `0.0.0.0:8080:8080` opens it to your network,
and `msbctl` says so. The connection comes in rather than going out, so the
egress rules don't apply. Ports are stored in the registry entry, not the
project, since a host port is one machine's to hand out; `msbctl` warns when
another sandbox already publishes the same one. They're fixed at create time,
and `msbctl edit` → "Published ports" changes them too.

## Project setup and environment

```toml title=".msb/sandbox.toml"
[bootstrap]
packages = ["postgresql-client"]       # extra apt packages
script   = "scripts/sandbox-setup.sh"  # run last, inside the guest, from the project folder

[env]
SOME_PROJECT_FLAG = "1"                # merged over the machine-wide [env]
```

The setup script runs once, at create time, after everything else, for things
like `npm ci`. A failure is reported, not fatal. Environment variables are
create-time, like mounts.

## Your network

For hosts on your LAN (a Git server, a package mirror), define a group once in
`config.toml`, or use `msbctl setup` → "your network". If those names resolve
to private addresses, list the group under `private_dns_groups`, so sandboxes
that use it get `allow_private_dns` automatically.

A group of your own stays on your machine. `msbctl add` and `msbctl edit` →
"Features & agents" put it in the sandbox's registry entry as
`extra_rule_groups`, which adds to the project's `rule_groups`, rather than
in the project's committed `.msb/sandbox.toml`: nobody who clones the project
has that group, and in their copy it would make every create fail with
"unknown rule group". A shipped group you redefined keeps its name everywhere,
so it stays in the project. If an older msbctl put one of yours in the
project, `msbctl show` warns, and `msbctl edit` → "Features & agents" moves
it. Machine-local groups aren't part of the [policy pin](egress.md#the-policy-pin). See
[DNS resolution is part of the rule](egress.md#dns-resolution-is-part-of-the-rule).

## Your CLAUDE.md additions

`~/.config/msb/CLAUDE.local.md` is appended to msb-manager's shipped
instructions, and the result is copied into every sandbox's `~/.claude` on each
start. Edit it from the main menu ("edit your CLAUDE.md additions") or directly.
Editing the copy *inside* a sandbox does nothing: it's overwritten on the next
start.

Each sandbox's copy also ends with a short "This sandbox" section, written by
msbctl: one line per feature it has (podman, python, …), how git reaches
GitHub, and where the project is mounted — including its `.agents/skills/`
folder, because this file lives in the agent's home and a project that splits
its instructions across skill files has to be pointed at them by absolute path.
It's built from the current config on every start, so after an edit that still
needs a rebuild it describes the sandbox you'll get, not yet the one that's
running. `msbctl edit <name>` → "View the CLAUDE.md it gets" shows the whole
file as that sandbox will receive it.

## Autostart

Mark a sandbox to start whenever the picker opens:
`msbctl edit .` → "Identity & autostart". `msbctl start --autostart` starts
that set from anywhere; on a host with nobody at it, `msbctl host autostart
install` runs it at boot (see [Remote hosts](remote-hosts.md#setting-up-a-host)). An idle sandbox costs about 300 MB,
and a running one is the only kind whose installed versions can be checked.
