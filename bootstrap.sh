# One bootstrap for every registered sandbox. Everything a per-project
# launcher would hardcode arrives here as an environment variable, set by
# msbctl from the sandbox's resolved [versions] table and its project's
# [bootstrap] section:
#
#   MSB_NODE_MAJOR        node major line                      (default 22)
#   MSB_GITLEAKS_VERSION  pinned
#   MSB_GH_VERSION        pinned; checksum-verified below
#   MSB_BUN_VERSION       pinned; checksum-verified below
#   MSB_EXTRA_PACKAGES    space-separated apt packages for this project
#   MSB_WANT_CLAUDE       1 to install Claude Code (default 1)
#   MSB_WANT_BUN          1 to install bun
#   MSB_WANT_GITLEAKS     1 to install gitleaks
#   MSB_CONTAINERS_STORAGE  "fuse-overlayfs" to point podman at it
#   MSB_CACHE_LINKS       space-separated MOUNT:DEST pairs; DEST becomes a symlink to MOUNT
#   MSB_PROJECT_DIR       where the project is mounted (default /work)
#   MSB_PROJECT_SCRIPT    path under the project to run last, if any
#   MSB_CLONE_URL         https://github.com/<repo>.git for a sandbox with no host
#                         folder: cloned into MSB_PROJECT_DIR (a disk volume) once.
#                         Empty for a folder sandbox
#   MSB_CLONE_REF         the branch, tag or commit to check out
#
# msbctl writes this file into the guest over stdin rather than mounting it.
# The guest can see the project and the read-only profile directory and nothing else,
# and keeping the manager's own code out of every sandbox is the point.
#
# Deliberately not `set -e`. Every step runs, records its own outcome, and the
# summary lists all failures at once — so one missing egress rule does not hide
# the next, and building an allowlist stays a bounded job rather than a series
# of round trips.

   Bootstrap complete. It will not run again unless the sandbox is rebuilt.

   Not done here, deliberately:
     - git identity. msbctl applies the chosen one with `git config --system`
       on every START, not here, so changing it in config.toml takes effect on
       the next start rather than needing a rebuild. --system is the lowest
       layer, so a repo's own .git/config still wins — which is the point.
     - gh auth. GH_TOKEN is a `--secret` placeholder swapped on egress; use
       `gh` normally and never `gh auth login`.
     - the managed CLAUDE.md. msbctl copies it in on every start, not once
       here, so editing it on the host takes effect on the next start.
